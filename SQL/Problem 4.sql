-- Problem 4
-- A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
-- Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

-- Note: We can assume that the largest palindrome will be a product of 9XX numbers
